## Features

- **Dynamic Pass Generation**: Create Apple Wallet passes with customizable details such as expiry date, service type, discount, background color, and images.
- **Image Processing**: Utilizes [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) for efficient image resizing and processing.
- **Express Server**: Handles HTTP requests for pass generation and serves the generated passes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Apple Wallet Certificates**: Obtain the necessary certificates from Apple's developer portal and place them in the `certs` directory:
  - `signerCert.pem`
  - `signerKey.pem`
  - `wwdr.pem`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhampatel10122002/pass.git
   cd pass
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure Your Pass Model**:

   - Place your pass model files in the `models` directory. Ensure that your model includes all necessary assets and a valid `pass.json` file.

2. **Start the Server**:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Generate a Pass**:

   - Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/generate-pass` with a JSON payload containing the following fields:
     - `expiryDate` (optional): The expiration date of the pass.
     - `serviceType` (optional): The type of service associated with the pass.
     - `discount` (required): The discount value to display on the pass.
     - `backgroundColor` (optional): The background color of the pass in `rgb(r, g, b)` format.
     - `stripImage` (optional): A base64-encoded string of the image to be used as the strip image on the pass.

   Example JSON payload:

   ```json
   {
     "expiryDate": "2025-12-31",
     "serviceType": "Tech Support",
     "discount": "25%",
     "backgroundColor": "rgb(41, 128, 185)",
     "stripImage": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
   }
   ```

   The response will contain a JSON object with the `passUrl` and `passId`.
