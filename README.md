# Pass Generation with Node.js

This project provides a Node.js application for generating custom Apple Wallet passes. It utilizes the [passkit-generator](https://github.com/alexandercerutti/passkit-generator) library to facilitate the creation of passes.

## Features

- **Customizable Pass Models**: Define and use custom pass models stored in the `models` directory.
- **Certificate Management**: Manage your Apple Wallet certificates in the `certs` directory.
- **Icon Creation**: Includes a script for creating icons for your passes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Apple Wallet Certificates**: Obtain the necessary certificates from Apple's developer portal and place them in the `certs` directory.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhampatel10122002/pass.git
   cd pass
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure Your Pass Model**:

   - Place your pass model files in the `models` directory. Ensure that your model includes all necessary assets and a valid `pass.json` file.

2. **Run the Application**:

   - To generate a pass, execute:

     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```

   - The generated pass will be output as specified in your application logic.

3. **Create Icons (Optional)**:

   - If you need to create icons for your pass, you can use the provided script:

     ```bash
     node create-icon.js
     ```

     Ensure that the script is configured correctly to generate the desired icons.
